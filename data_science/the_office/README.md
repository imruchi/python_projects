How much time did I spend watching my favourite show?
I was curious to see how long I spent watching my go-to TV show- The Office. 


To download your Viewing Activity:

Click on the link below and log into your Netflix account. 

https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo

On the next page, you should see a red colour 'Submit Request' button. And then, unfortunately, you will have to wait. Consider bookmarking this page so that you can come back once youâ€™ve got your data. Netflix will email you when your report is available to download.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, we want to access the ViewingActivity.csv file. For that, click on the Content Interaction folder.

And that's it! You have access to your Netflix history and viewing activity which is exactly what we need to go ahead with this project!
